## Features

### __v1.2__

### Adding a transaction: `addTransaction`

Adds a Transaction.
`addTransaction`
Creates a transaction for multiple people with customised split ratios.

Format: `addTransaction d=DETAILS n=NAME c=COST [ts=TIME] [n=NAME w=WEIGHT]...`
- Cost and weights have to be decimal numbers or fractions, and they must be positive.
- The first name refers to the payee (that is the person whom everyone else now owes).
- If the timestamp is not provided, the default time is the current system time.
- If you want to create a weight for yourself, include `n=Self` to refer to yourself.
- At least one pair of name and weight must be provided.
- The cost for each person is calculated as follows:
    - Individual cost = Total Cost * (Individual Weight / Total Weight)

Examples:
* `addTransaction d=Dinner n=Self c=100 n=John w=2 n=Mary w=2 n=Alice w=1`
    * Dinner costed $100 was first paid by self; now John and Mary each owe self $40 (2/5 of $100 each), Alice owes self $20 (1/5 of $100)
* `addTransaction d=Rent n=John c=600 ts=2020-10-10T12:00 n=Self w=1 n=John w=1 n=Mary =w1`
    * Rent costed $600 and was first paid by John at 12 o'clock on 10 October 2020; now self owes John $200 (1/3 of $600)

Sample execution:
```
$ addTransaction d=Dinner n=self c=100 n=John w=2 n=Mary w=2 n=Alice w=1

```

$ addTransaction c=200 d=Textbooks

Invalid command format! 
addTransaction: Adds a transaction to the address book.

The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Transaction details that can be edited:

* Description
* Cost
* Payee

Format: `editTransaction INDEX [d=DESCRIPTION] [c=COST] [n=PAYEE]`

TransactionList. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Portion refers to the amount of money that a person owes you for a transaction. \
The portion is calculated based on the cost of the transaction and the proportion of the transaction that the person has

are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

## FAQ

### Why do the portions in the log not add up exactly to the balance?

The portions displayed are rounded to a fixed number of decimal places. This means there may be fractional differences
between the actual portions and what is displayed.

Example:

```
If these are the logs stored:
A:      0.122
B:      0.223
Total:  0.345

This is displayed instead when the app is set to show 2 decimal places:
A:      0.12
B:      0.22
Total:  0.35
```
