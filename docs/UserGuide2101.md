## Key Terms

<!-- The Spend N Split application links transactions and people. As such, it is important that you familiarise yourself with the structure of each person and each transaction in our application. -->

In the Spend N Split application, transactions and people play a crucial role. It's important to familiarise yourself with the structure of both individuals and transactions within our application.

### Person

<!-- A person is someone that you track your balance against. Before creating a transaction involving a specific person, that person has to exist in the application. If not, that person has to be added to the application before the transaction is created. -->

A person represents an individual whom you track your financial balances against. To create a transaction involving a specific person, that person's contact must already have been added into the application. If not, you'll need to add them before recording the transaction.

A person has the following attributes:
- Name (Compulsory)
- Balance (Calculated by the application)
- Tag(s) (Optional)
- Phone number (Optional)
- Telegram handle (Optional)
- Email Address (Optional)
- Address (Optional)

Each person is identified by their names. Names are case-insensitive and the application does not support duplicate names. This means that you cannot add two or more people with the same name.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: If a positive balance is displayed on a person, it means that they owe you money. Conversely, if the balance displayed is
negative, you owe that person money instead.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Transaction

Transactions represent events involving the exchange of money.

A transaction has the following attributes:
- Description (Compulsory)
- Payee (Compulsory)
- Payer (Compulsory)
- Amount (Compulsory)
- Timestamp (Optional. If this is not provided, the application will use the current time on your computer)
- Portion(s)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:warning: There are 2 special names when adding transactions - "Self" and "Others". "Self" refers to you (the user of this application) and "Others" refers to people that have not been added to the application.
</div>

After a transaction, each payer in the list of portions owes the payee a fraction of the amount, based on their weights in the list of portions.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:warning: Notes about the command format:<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. In `addPerson n=NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter to be provided by the user. <br>Example usage: `addPerson n=John Doe`.

- Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  E.g. For `n=NAME [t=TAG]`: <br> Example usage `n=John Doe t=friend` or `n=John Doe`.

- Items followed by `…` are optional and can be listed multiple times.<br>
  E.g. For `[t=TAG]…​`: <br> Example usage: " " (0 tags), or `t=friend` (1 tag) or `t=friend t=family` (2 tags).

- Throughout this guide, if it is mentioned that the order of the parameters is flexible, it means that you can arrange the parameters in any order you prefer. <br>
  E.g. For `n=NAME p=PHONE` <br> Example usage: `n=Bob p=91722828` or `p=91722828 n=Bob` are both accepted and will be treated as equivalent inputs by the application.

- Unnecessary parameters provided for commands (such as `help`, `clear`, `exit`) that do not accept them will be disregarded. <br> E.g. for the command `help` which does not accept any parameters, entering the command `help 123` will be interpreted by the application as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands. Space characters such as " " may result in errors. It is recommended that commands are manually copied and typed into the application.

### Person-related features

#### Add your friends as contacts using `addPerson`

Want to start tracking your expenses with someone new? Start by creating a new contact with the command `addPerson`.

Format: `addPerson n=NAME [p=PHONE] [tg=TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e=EMAIL] [a=ADDRESS] [t=TAG]…​`

Need help with the formatting of commands? [Click here](#Features)

Example: `addPerson n=Betsy Crowe p=90903211 tg=@betsy_crowe e=betsycrowe@gmail.com a=London Block 55 t=friend`

You have now added **Betsy Crowe**, along with her phone number, Telegram, email and address! You have also tagged her as a friend using `t=friend`.


![addPerson_success](images/user-guide/addPersonSuccess.png)

#### Edit your contacts with `editPerson`

Already have your friend's contact in the app, but need to update their contact information? Do so easily with the `editPerson` command.

Format: `editPerson INDEX [n=NAME] [p=PHONE] [tg=TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e=EMAIL] [a=ADDRESS] [t=TAG]…​`

Need help with the formatting of commands? [Click here](#Features)

<!-- would be nice to include how to "lookup" the index of the person. e.g. search for the person, then index = number on their card -->

* Replace `INDEX` with the index number of the contact you want to edit. You can find the index number in the Person List.
* You can edit one or more of the contact's details, such as name, phone number, Telegram handle, email, address, or tags.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When you edit tags, the existing tags will be replaced with the new ones you specify.

After the command has been executed, every person in the application will be displayed in the Person List.

Examples:

* `editPerson 1 p=90904139 e=aliceyu123@gmail.com`
    * This command changes the phone number and email address of the first contact to be 90904139 and aliceyu123@gmail.com, respectively.
* `editPerson 2 n=Betsy Crower t=`
    * This command changes the name of the second contact to Betsy Crower and clear all existing tags.

![editPerson_success](images/user-guide/editPersonSuccess.png)

#### Delete a contact using `deletePerson`

Need to remove a contact from your list? Whether you want to declutter your contacts or remove someone for any other reason, `deletePerson` handles the task.

Format: `deletePerson INDEX`

Need help with the formatting of commands? [Click here](#Features)

* Replace `INDEX` with the index number of the contact you want to edit. You can find the index number in the Person List.

Example: `deletePerson 1`

This command deletes the first contact from the Person List. All your existing expenses involving that person will be updated accordingly in the Transaction List.

![deletePerson_success](images/user-guide/deletePersonSuccess.png)

#### Find your contacts using `listPerson`

If you want to find specific contacts in your list, you can use the `listPerson` command. It helps you search for and list persons whose names contain certain keywords.

Format: `listPerson [KEYWORD]...`

Need help with the formatting of commands? [Click here](#Features)

* You can enter one or more keywords separated by spaces to search for specific contacts. If no keywords are entered, all contacts will be displayed.
* The search is case-insensitive.
* It is considered a match if any of the words in the person's name is exactly the same as any of the given keywords. For instance, a person named `Han Junior` will not be displayed when you execute `listPerson Hans Hanzala` where the two given keywords are `Hans` and `Hanzala`

Examples:

* `listPerson`
    * This command displays all of your contacts in the application.
* `listPerson alex david`
    * This command display all of your contacts with names that match at least one keyword, such as `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`.

![listPersonFiltered_success](images/user-guide/listPersonFilteredSuccess.png)

#### Order your contacts by their outstanding balance using `sortPerson`

You can sort your list of contacts in the application based on their outstanding balances, making it easy to identify who owes the most or the least amount of money.

If someone has a negative balance, it means that you owe them money!

Format: `sortPerson ORDER`

Specify `ORDER` to indicate the sorting order:
* Use `-` for ascending order (largest negative balance at the top).
* Use `+` for descending order (largest positive balance at the top).

Examples:
* `sortPerson -`
    * This command will rearrange the Person List in ascending order of balances.
* `sortPerson +`
    * This command will rearrange the Person List in descending order of balances.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Transaction-related features

#### Create a new transaction with `addTransaction`

To easily keep track of a new transaction, simply use the addTransaction command.

Format: `addTransaction d=DETAILS n=NAME c=COST [ts=TIME] [n=NAME w=WEIGHT]...`

Need help with the formatting of commands? [Click here](#Features)

- The first name refers to the payee (that is the person whom everyone else now owes money).
- If the timestamp is not provided, the default time is the current time on your computer.
- If only the date is given, the default time is set as `00:00`.
- If you want to reference yourself, use `n=Self`.
- The cost for each person is calculated as follows:
    - `Individual Cost = Total Cost * (Individual Weight / Total Weight)`

Examples:
* `addTransaction d=Rent n=David Li c=600 ts=10/10/2020 12:00 n=Self w=1 n=David Li w=1 n=Alex Yeoh w=1`

    * Creates a new transaction that is identical to the 1st transaction in the displayed list, except for the timestamp of the new transaction being the time at which this command was executed.

#### List your transactions with `listTransaction`

If you want to find specific transactions, you can use the `listTransaction` command.

Format: `listTransaction [KEYWORD]...`

- It is a match if any of the words in a name is exactly the same as any of the keywords.
- If a transaction's description matches at least one keyword, they will be displayed.

Examples:

* `listTransaction`
    * Shows all transactions.
* `listTransaction Lunch Dinner`
    * Shows all transactions with descriptions include either the keyword "Lunch", "Dinner", or both.
