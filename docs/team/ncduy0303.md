### Project: Spend n Split

Spend n Split (SnS) is a **desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SnS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
