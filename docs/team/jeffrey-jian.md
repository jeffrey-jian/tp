### Project: Spend n Split

### Overview
Spend n Split (SnS) is a **desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you can type fast, SnS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

[//]: # (* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.)

[//]: # (  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.)

[//]: # (  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.)

[//]: # (  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.)
