**Spend n Split (SnS) is a desktop app for managing expense from contacts**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SnS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* Main features:
  * Manage contacts and their personal information
  * Manage expenses between you and your contacts
* If you are interested in using AddressBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
